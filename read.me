This Python-based toolkit is a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level utilities designed for educational purposes in the areas of:

Cryptography

Network analysis

Password security

System monitoring

Each tool is a standalone script with its own functionality and can be used individually.

✅ Ethical Use Only
All tools are intended for learning, demonstrations, or use on systems/networks you own or have permission to access.

🧰 Included Tools
| Tool No. | Name                                  | Description                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Caesar Cipher Tool                    | Encrypt/decrypt messages using a simple letter-shifting algorithm.                             |
| 2        | Image Encryption Tool                 | Encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating RGB pixel values with a numeric key.                |
| 3        | Password Strength Checker + Generator | Check if a password is strong, and generate secure random ones.                                |
| 4        | Keylogger (Basic)                     | Capture and save keyboard inputs to a file.                                                    |
| 5        | Packet Sniffer                        | Capture network traffic to/from a specified target and analyze protocols, ports, and payloads. |

🛠 Requirements
All tools require Python 3.x. Some tools require external libraries:
| Tool       | Required Library |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Image Tool | `Pillow`         |
| Keylogger  | `pynput`         |
| Sniffer    | `scapy`          |

Install dependencies via:
pip install pillow pynput scapy

🔧 How to Run
Each script is standalone. To run a specific tool:
python tool_name.py

For example:
python caesar_cipher.py
python password_tool.py

⚠️ The packet sniffer and keylogger may require admin/root privileges to function correctly.
