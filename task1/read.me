Caesar Cipher Text Encryption & Decryption Tool
🔒 Overview
This is a simple Caesar Cipher tool written in Python that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift-based substitution cipher.

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

🚀 Features
Encrypts plain text using a user-defined shift.

Decrypts cipher text using the same shift.

Preserves uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).

Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries required.

📦 How to Use
Run the script:
python caesar_cipher.py

Follow the prompts:

Choose to encrypt or decrypt.

Enter your message.

Enter a shift value (an integer).

Example:
Type 'encrypt' to encrypt or 'decrypt' to decrypt: encrypt
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift value (integer): 3
Result: Khoor Zruog!

🔁 Example Shift Logic
Original: A B C D E F

Shift (+3): D E F G H I

Message: ABC → Encrypted: DEF

⚠️ Notes
Negative shift values are supported for reversing direction.

For accurate decryption, use the same shift used during encryption.

📚 Educational Use
This tool is intended for learning and practicing classical cryptography techniques. Caesar Cipher is not secure for modern applications.
